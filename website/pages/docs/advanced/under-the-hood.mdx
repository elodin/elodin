# Under The Hood

Elodin defines a set of style properties that many platforms have in common. During compilation, all components are parsed into an AST where all properties are strongly validated to match their provided types. This AST is then used to generate native platform-specific code using so called generators. Each generator targets a specific platform and has many different configuration options in order to satisfy as much requirements as possible.
