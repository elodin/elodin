# Command Line Interface

```bash
yarn add --dev @elodin/cli
```

This package provides the CLI for Elodin with compilation commands.<br/>
It requires a valid [Elodin configuration](/docs/setup/configuration) to run.

## Usage

```shell
# Single build
elodin

# Single build with cleanup
elodin -c

# Single build + build on every change
elodin -w

# Single build with cleanup + build on every change
elodin -c -w

# Build on every change
elodin -w -sib
```

## Configuration

The CLI comes with a set of configuration options.<br />
One can also use run `elodin --help` or `elodin -h` for a quick overview of all the configuration options.

| Option                       | Default              | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--config [path]`            | _./elodin.config.js_ | The relative path to your [Elodin configuration](/docs/setup/configuration).                                                |
| `--watch, -w`                |                      | Enables watch mode to automatically recompile on file changes.                                                              |
| `--clean, -c`                |                      | Remove previously generated files before compilation. Helps to get rid of old files where the Elodin file has been removed. |
| `--skip-initial-build, -sib` |                      | Skips the initial build in watch mode.<br />_Only works with watch mode enabled_.                                           |

## Watch Mode

Watch mode (using either `--watch` or the shorthand `-w` flag) will automatically recompile all files on detected file changes.<br />
This is very useful for development, where you want to apply changes immediately without having to compile manually again and again.
