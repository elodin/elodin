# FAQ

### Do I have to rewrite everything again?

**No!** Elodin can be gradually adopted. Start small with just one component and test how and if it fits into your project. In general, you don't have to rewrite your code as long as it works fine. Yet, if it's hard to maintain and error-prone, it might improve stability to refactor styles to Elodin files due to benefits such as type-safety and code-splitting.

### Can I remove Elodin later on?

**Yes!** In theory, you can remove Elodin at any given point of time and just use the generated files instead. It aims to generate readable code and usually doesn't require a runtime to work.
