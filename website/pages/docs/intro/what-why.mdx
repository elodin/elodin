# What & Why

## Why an extra language?

Gone are the days where products only target a specific platform. Nowadays our customers expect us to support all kind of platforms, devices and system. We have browser apps, mobile apps, tv apps, VR apps and even embedded apps e.g. in cars.
Given their different requirements, capabilities and technological background, we use very different languages, libraries and tools to built those apps. While this accounts for performant and high-quality apps on all platforms, it also leads to duplicate implementations of a similar UI without a way to reuse the underlying primitives.<br />
Yet, most platforms share quite a lot visual properties. After all, we want to implement a similar visual experience everywhere to create a seamless user experience across platforms.<br />
That's where Elodin enters the game. It provides an easy-to-use declarative format to define primitive style components, which then compiles to native applicable code for all kind of different platforms.
